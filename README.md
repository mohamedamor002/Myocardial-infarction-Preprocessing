# Myocardial Infarction Complications Prediction

## Overview

This repository contains a dataset and preprocessing notebook related to the prediction of complications in Myocardial Infarction (MI) patients. The goal of this project is to apply data mining and pattern recognition techniques to predict complications at different stages of hospitalization and to explore disease phenotyping.

## Dataset Description

The dataset enables research into two key problems:

1. **Predicting Complications of MI**
   - Based on patient information at the time of admission.
   - Based on patient information on the third day of hospitalization.
2. **Disease Phenotyping and Visualization**
   - Cluster analysis for patient stratification.
   - Identification of disease progression trajectories.
   - Disease mapping for visualization.

MI is a serious medical condition with high mortality rates, especially within the first year after occurrence. Predicting complications can help in timely intervention and better patient management.

## Repository Contents

- `DataPrep.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing data preprocessing steps.
- `README.md`: This documentation file.

## Installation and Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/myocardial-infarction-prediction.git
